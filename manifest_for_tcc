# This file follows a very simple, human readable and machine parseable syntax.
# Each line is in the format:
# <directive>: <arguments> <predicate>
#
# The supported directives and arguments are:
# - build; simply builds a particular package.
#   eg, build: make-3.82
# - improve; runs a script that makes a distinct and logical improvement to the system.
#   eg, improve: use_fhs
# - define: define a variable based upon other variables
#   eg, define: BUILD_FIWIX = KERNEL_BOOTSTRAP == True || BUILD_KERNELS == True
# - jump: jump (usually) to a new kernel, executes a script with that name
#   eg, jump: fiwix
# - uninstall; removes a package or filenames
#   eg, uninstall: perl-5.6.2
#   eg, uninstall: /usr/bin/lex /usr/bin/flex
#
# The following directives have special significance:
# - build directives beginning with "bash" (as well as jumps) trigger the generation of
#   a new script
# - the first improve directive containing "network" is used by generator.py to deduce
#   what source files need to be downloaded in advance (files referenced after that will
#   be downloaded during bootstrap, unless --external-sources is given)
#
# Other features:
# - predicate; based on variables set in bootstrap.cfg, require for something to execute
#   must be enclosed in brackets with spaces padded
#   eg, build: fiwix-1.5.0-lb1 ( BUILD_FIWIX == True )
