		" * - A dynamic block starts with a description of the literal/length and",
		" *   distance codes for that block.  New dynamic blocks allow the compressor to",
		" *   rapidly adapt to changing data with new codes optimized for that data.",
		" *",
		" * - The codes used by the deflate format are \"canonical\", which means that",
		" *   the actual bits of the codes are generated in an unambiguous way simply",
		" *   from the number of bits in each code.  Therefore the code descriptions",
		" *   are simply a list of code lengths for each symbol.",
		" *",
		" * - The code lengths are stored in order for the symbols, so lengths are",
		" *   provided for each of the literal/length symbols, and for each of the",
		" *   distance symbols.",
		" *",
		" * - If a symbol is not used in the block, this is represented by a zero as",
		" *   as the code length.  This does not mean a zero-length code, but rather",
		" *   that no code should be created for this symbol.  There is no way in the",
		" *   deflate format to represent a zero-length code.",
		" *",
		" * - The maximum number of bits in a code is 15, so the possible lengths for",
		" *   any code are 1..15.",
		" *",
		" * - The fact that a length of zero is not permitted for a code has an",
		" *   interesting consequence.  Normally if only one symbol is used for a given",
		" *   code, then in fact that code could be represented with zero bits.  However",
		" *   in deflate, that code has to be at least one bit.  So for example, if",
		" *   only a single distance base symbol appears in a block, then it will be",
		" *   represented by a single code of length one, in particular one 0 bit.  This",
		" *   is an incomplete code, since if a 1 bit is received, it has no meaning,",
		" *   and should result in an error.  So incomplete distance codes of one symbol",
		" *   should be permitted, and the receipt of invalid codes should be handled.",
		" *",
		" * - It is also possible to have a single literal/length code, but that code",
		" *   must be the end-of-block code, since every dynamic block has one.  This",
		" *   is not the most efficient way to create an empty block (an empty fixed",
		" *   block is fewer bits), but it is allowed by the format.  So incomplete",
		" *   literal/length codes of one symbol should also be permitted.",
		" *",
		" * - If there are only literal codes and no lengths, then there are no distance",
		" *   codes.  This is represented by one distance code with zero bits.",
		" *",
		" * - The list of up to 286 length/literal lengths and up to 30 distance lengths",
		" *   are themselves compressed using Huffman codes and run-length encoding.  In",
		" *   the list of code lengths, a 0 symbol means no code, a 1..15 symbol means",
		" *   that length, and the symbols 16, 17, and 18 are run-length instructions.",
		" *   Each of 16, 17, and 18 are follwed by extra bits to define the length of",
		" *   the run.  16 copies the last length 3 to 6 times.  17 represents 3 to 10",
		" *   zero lengths, and 18 represents 11 to 138 zero lengths.  Unused symbols",
		" *   are common, hence the special coding for zero lengths.",
		" *",
		" * - The symbols for 0..18 are Huffman coded, and so that code must be",
		" *   described first.  This is simply a sequence of up to 19 three-bit values",
		" *   representing no code (0) or the code length for that symbol (1..7).",
		" *",
		" * - A dynamic block starts with three fixed-size counts from which is computed",
		" *   the number of literal/length code lengths, the number of distance code",
		" *   lengths, and the number of code length code lengths (ok, you come up with",
		" *   a better name!) in the code descriptions.  For the literal/length and",
		" *   distance codes, lengths after those provided are considered zero, i.e. no",
		" *   code.  The code length code lengths are received in a permuted order (see",
		" *   the order[] array below) to make a short code length code length list more",
		" *   likely.  As it turns out, very short and very long codes are less likely",
		" *   to be seen in a dynamic code description, hence what may appear initially",
		" *   to be a peculiar ordering.",
		" *",
		" * - Given the number of literal/length code lengths (nlen) and distance code",
		" *   lengths (ndist), then they are treated as one long list of nlen + ndist",
		" *   code lengths.  Therefore run-length coding can and often does cross the",
		" *   boundary between the two sets of lengths.",
		" *",
		" * - So to summarize, the code description at the start of a dynamic block is",
		" *   three counts for the number of code lengths for the literal/length codes,",
		" *   the distance codes, and the code length codes.  This is followed by the",
		" *   code length code lengths, three bits each.  This is used to construct the",
		" *   code length code which is used to read the remainder of the lengths.  Then",
		" *   the literal/length code lengths and distance lengths are read as a single",
		" *   set of lengths using the code length codes.  Codes are constructed from",
